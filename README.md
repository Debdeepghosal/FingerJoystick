# Hand Gesture Control using MediaPipe and OpenCV

This Python script demonstrates real-time hand gesture control using MediaPipe and OpenCV libraries. The code tracks hand movements through a webcam feed, recognizing specific gestures to control keyboard inputs.

## Features
- Detects hand landmarks using MediaPipe
- Interprets hand gestures to control keyboard inputs
- Recognizes gestures for directional movements (Right, Left, Forward) and special actions (Shift)

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- Mediapipe
- pynput

## Usage
1. Install the required libraries using `pip`:
   ```bash
   pip install opencv-python mediapipe pynput
